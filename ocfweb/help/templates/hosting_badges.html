            with the OCF, or for anyone else that wants to use them.  You can
            either use the images hosted on our site, or you can download them
            and place them under your own. You're welcome to design your own
            too, but please
            <a href="{% url 'help' 'contact' %}">contact us</a> first.

        <h3>About these logos</h3>
        <p>
            The "silver", "mini", "platinum" edition logos were original logos
            created by gordeon in 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "blue" logo is based off the "silver" logo and was contributed by
            the student group Ensorcelled in 2008.
