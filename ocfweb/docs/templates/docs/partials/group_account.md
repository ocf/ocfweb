If you are a signatory of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) or other
eligible group here at Berkeley, then you are can create a group account for
your organization. Group accounts may not be used for printing, but do provide
your RSO with access to other services, such as web and mail hosting.

To request a group account, please come to
[OCF staff hours](ocf.io/staff-hours). If you're not sure if your group is
eligible for a group account, refer to our
[eligibility page](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/membership/eligibility/#h2_groups).

## Web Hosting (group.berkeley.edu)

When you create any OCF account, you gain access to web hosting space on our
domain: ocf.berkeley.edu/\~yourusername. However, eligible groups may also
request their own subdomains of the berkeley.edu domain, i.e.
group.berkeley.edu. This allows you to create a website for your student group.
There are various requirements set by the University and the OCF for such
websites; for instructions on setting up your website, visit our
[web hosting documentation](ocf.io/vhost) or visit the lab during
[staff hours](ocf.io/staff-hours).

## Mail Hosting (president@group.berkeley.edu)

Once you've set up your website, you can also enable email forwarding so you
can send and receive emails from arbitrary addresses on your domain, i.e.
president@group.berkeley.edu. Emails sent to these addresses will be forwarded
to your @berkeley.edu student account, and if desired, you can also send email
from these addresses by following
[these instructions](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/vhost/mail/gmail/).

Your custom email addresses can be easily managed online, without having to
come to OCF staff hours. For more information, visit our
[mail hosting documentation](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/vhost/mail/).

## Free Computing and File Storage

Like any other account, group accounts allow you to sign into OCF computers,
SSH into our account server, and store up to 15 GB indefinitely. The main
service which is not available to group accounts is free printing. For
information about other services available to all accounts, such as free
computing and file storage, visit [our account page](LINK-GOES-HERE).
