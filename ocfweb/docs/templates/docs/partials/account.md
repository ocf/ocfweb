Many think of the Open Computing Facility as an on-campus resource for free
printing. While this is true, and printing is certainly our most-demanded
service (we print hundreds of thousands of pages per year), there are plenty of
other great services provided by the OCF, which come free with your account!

Note: the following information applies to individual accounts, not group
accounts. To request an account for your student group, or for information on
student group web hosting, check out
[our group account page](LINK-GOES-HERE).

## Free Computing

The OCF was founded to provide all members of the Cal campus community with
computing resources. Anytime we're open, all members of the community are
welcome to use the computers for any reason – not just to print. All of the
computers in the OCF run Linux and have a variety of useful applications
pre-installed.
* Google Chrome, Firefox, and Brave are all installed, allowing you to choose
your preferred web browser.
* The LibreOffice suite is installed as an alternative to Microsoft Office. It
is mostly cross-compatible with Office files, meaning one can import or export
.docx/.pptx/.xlsx files. You can also use Google Docs from a web browser.
* GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is provided as an alternative to Adobe
Photoshop, and Inkscape replaces Adobe Illustrator. For animation and 3D
modeling, we provide access to Blender.
* Rather than iTunes/QuickTime or Windows Media Player, you can access music or
video files using VLC.
* Pre-installed IDEs include Atom and Visual Studio Code.
* The default PDF utility is Document Viewer, which can be used to view, print,
and edit PDFs.
* Steam is installed, if you would like to play video games.
Most of these applications can be found on the desktop, and all applications
can be accessed from the menu in the top-left corner of the screen, analogous
to the Start menu in Windows. We also offer three computers with dedicated
scanners, and one with a CD/DVD reader.

## Persistent File Storage

When you log out of one of our desktop computers, any files you saved to that
computer will be erased. This is because most files saved to these computers
are immediately printed, so there is no need to take up disk space holding onto
them. However, some users may wish to have access to their files every time
they log in to an OCF desktop. As part of your OCF account, you gain access to
15 GB of free file storage on OCF servers. This file storage is accessible by
clicking on the "OCF File Storage" icon on any desktop computer or by
[SSHing into our account server](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/shell/).

Files placed in the "OCF File Storage" folder are accessible from any desktop
computer and are saved even after you log out, whereas files placed in the
"Home" folder are local to that computer and are deleted upon log-out. The "OCF
File Storage" folder should contain a folder called "public_html", which is
used for web hosting – see below.

## Free Printing

By signing up for an account, you get 200 free sides of printing (200 pages
single-sided, 100 pages double-sided). We print black-and-white only, in
economode (meaning the ink may be a bit lighter than expected). You are limited
to 20 sides of printing per day. We ask that you download or export any
documents they wish to print as PDFs first, as these work best with our print
server.

## Web Hosting

When you create an OCF account, you also gain acccess to web hosting space on
our domain: ocf.berkeley.edu/\~yourusername. You can create your own website
using HTML/CSS/JS or use a system like WordPress or Django. Alternatively, you
can use your website as file storage. For more technical information on
building your website, check out
[our web hosting page](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/web/).

If you are a signatory of a student group and would like to request a website
under the berkeley.edu domain (i.e. ocf.berkeley.edu) you will need to create a
group account and complete a few steps before making your request. Instructions
can be found on [our vhost page](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/vhost/).

## Miscellaneous

The OCF provides various other services to all users, such as access to our
high-performance computing cluster, Mastadon instance, software mirrors, a
personal MySQL database, and more. For a full list and futher (more technical)
documentation, visit [our services page](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/docs/services/).
