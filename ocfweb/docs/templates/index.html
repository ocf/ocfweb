            Our hard-working student volunteers (hereafter OCF staff) try to keep
            documentation plentiful and up-to-date, but it's always lagging behind.

            We recommend starting off by reading the

            <a href="{% url 'doc' 'staff' %}">technical documentation</a>
            intended for staffers?
