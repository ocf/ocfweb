[[!meta title="Additional documentation"]]

Additional documentation not published publicly can be found at
`~staff/privdocs` on supernova.

Generally, staff documentation should be placed on this website whenever
possible. However, sometimes there are things which should be documented, but
wouldn't be appropriate to document publicly. In only that case, it should be
placed under the unpublished documentation.
