[[!meta title="Email Templates"]]

General email response templates can be found at [templates.ocf.berkeley.edu](https://templates.ocf.berkeley.edu) for purposes such as sending requests for DNS to the University hostmaster and notifying banned users. Templates should be used when applicable because they are designed to provide all necessary information while remaining cordial to the recipient.

Some templates have variables that should be filled out before copying the template. The template variables will be automatically filled out by entering text into the input boxes above the main text box. Variables can be located in the template by looking for `{<variable name>}` before filling it out.

## Adding templates
New templates can be added to the website by submitting a pull request to the [ocf/templates](https://ocf.io/gh/templates) repo. Template files are found in `templates/www/templates`. Variables can be added in a template as `{<variable name>}`.
