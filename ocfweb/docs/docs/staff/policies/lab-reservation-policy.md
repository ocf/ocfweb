[[!meta title="Lab Reservation Policy"]]

Should the OCF lab be closed for the event requested, OCF staff (excluding
those at the front desk) should remain outside the OCF lab during the time
requested. Those at the front desk will continue to require that Cal ID’s be
shown to gain access to the OCF. However, should Staff also agree to respond to
all student group requests within one week and one day of their form submission
as it will need to be approved by the OCF’s Board of Directors.

It is likely that requests will be accepted that follow some base rules.
Firstly, the person who registers for the group MUST be a signatory of the
organization wishing to reserve the lab. In addition, the lab should not be
reserved for more than two hours within our standard operating times. Groups
are more likely to be approved if they demonstrate a specific need to use our
computers instead of any other space -- the manner in which our technology is
utilized should be mentioned in the reservation form.
