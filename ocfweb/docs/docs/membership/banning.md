[[!meta title="Banning policy"]]

_As amended by the Board of Directors, December 3, 2018._

Any member of the OCF staff may propose to ban a user from the OCF for willful
violation of OCF policies. Banned users may not enter the OCF lab or use any
OCF services.

Once a user is proposed to be banned, all staff with any involvement with the
user will be called to the next Board of Directors meeting, and those present
shall testify. The Board of Directors may then decide to ban the user with a ⅔
majority vote. If the violation of OCF policies is additionally a violation of
the UC Berkeley Student Code of Conduct, the GM will submit a report to the
Center of Student Conduct.

If the user is banned, they shall be promptly notified of the ban and given a
chance to appeal the ban at one of the next three future Board of Directors
meetings. At that meeting, they will be asked to explain their actions. The
Board of Directors then may decide with a ⅔ majority vote by secret ballot to
uphold the ban; if the ban is not upheld, it shall be rescinded.
