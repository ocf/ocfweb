[[!meta title="Joining the OCF"]]

## Before you begin

* Check the [[membership eligibility|doc membership/eligibility]] page to make
  sure you are eligible for an OCF account. For example, all currently-enrolled
  students and active student groups registered with the LEAD Center are
  eligible.

* OCF accounts do not expire, so make sure you have not made an account in the
  past. If you have forgotten your account name or password, please do not
  request a new account. Instead, reset your [[password|doc services/account]].

* We recommend that you choose a professional OCF account name. It is unlikely
  you will be able to change your account name after your request has been
  processed. For group accounts, your account name must be based on your
  group's name.

## Individual accounts

* Individual accounts are associated with a single person and may not be
  shared.
* Individual accounts are **not** eligible for [[virtual hosting|doc
  services/vhost]] except for faculty and staff accounts.
* Individual accounts are eligible for [[printing|doc services/lab/printing]].

**[[Request an account online|register]]**

You will be prompted to log in with CalNet. Then follow the instructions to
make your request.

Feel free to [[contact us|doc contact]] if you experience difficulties in the
request or you have questions.

Then, wait for your account to be created. (below)

## Group accounts

* Group accounts are associated with a group and may be shared by members of
  the group.
* Group accounts are eligible for [[virtual hosting|doc services/vhost]].
* Group accounts are **not** eligible for [[printing|doc
  services/lab/printing]].

Follow this procedure to get a group account:

**[[Request a group account online|register]]**

1. **If you are a registered student organization, have a signatory sign up using the link above.**
   While campus remains online due to the effects of COVID-19, you can
   create a group account online by having a signatory register using the link above.

2. **Otherwise, email help@ocf.berkeley.edu.**
   Please include the following information in your request:
   * Desired group username (list up to 3 in case any are taken).
   * Full group name
   * Group contact email address. Ideally, a group one that is monitored regularly.
   * Private email address for us to send a temporary password to.

## Account life

We don't actively close accounts. You don't need to re-apply for a new account
every semester, and you can still use your account after you graduate.

Because the OCF is funded by students for student use, we cater our services to
students, but it doesn't mean that your OCF account stops working after you
stop being a student. However, we will occasionally make changes to our
services based on the needs of current students and the abilities of current
OCF staff, so we can't promise all OCF account privileges and services into
perpetuity.
