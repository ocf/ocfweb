These are the official **Bylaws of the Open Computing Facility**, as last
amended at the Board meeting of May 7, 2025.

1. [Repealed]

2. The OCF Board of Directors shall meet at least once every two weeks while
   the OCF is formally in session.

3. Any Director appointed to the Board by the Decision Making Process missin
   two regularly scheduled meetings will be removed from the Board, regardless
   of whether the meetings achieve quorum. The only exception to this is if the
   Director informs the General Manager before the meeting of an emergency,
   including, but not limited to: a conflicting examination, a medical emergency,
   or a family emergency.

4. OCF Board meetings must be announced to all Directors at least twenty-four
   hours in advance.

5. Resolutions by the Board of Directors can be put to a vote electronically.
   When putting a resolution to the Board in this manner, all Board members
   must be included in the request for votes. To pass an issue this way,
   either at least half of all the Board members agree, or, quorum is achieved
   and a majority of voting Board members agree after allowing a period of
   forty-eight hours for Board members to vote. If the motion fails to achieve
   quorum with a majority of voting Board members agreeing after forty-eight
   hours of being called to such a vote, the motion fails. The results of the
   vote will be posted in roll call form.

6. Attendance lists and minutes for all OCF meetings shall be maintained for
   the decisions of that meeting to be valid.

7. BoD appointments and removals will take effect immediately after the vote at
   which the appointment or removal took place.

8. [Repealed]

9. The Cabinet

   1. The Cabinet of the Open Computing Facility shall consist of the General
      Manager, Site Manager, committee heads, and Deputy Site Managers.

   2. The General Manager shall be chair of the cabinet.

10. [Repealed]

11. [Repealed]

12. Deputy Site Managers

13. Officers

   1. All Cabinet members shall be Officers of the Open Computing Facility.

14. Any non-Director member who attends a Board meeting can request to be
    appointed as a Director at that meeting. A current Director must then

       2. The External Committee promotes OCF services and events to the broader
          campus community as appropriate, and manages relationships with companies,
