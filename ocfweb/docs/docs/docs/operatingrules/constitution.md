1. [March 6, 2017](#amended-2017-03-06)
2. [November 20, 2017](#amended-2017-11-20)

## Preamble
We, the computer-using community of the Berkeley campus of the University of
California, provide by this Constitution an organization dedicated to the
pursuit of obtaining and managing open computing resources. The intent of this
organization is to provide an environment where no member of Berkeley's campus
community is denied the computer resources they seek. This group's spirit can
be traced directly to the former Undergraduate Computing Facility; however,
this organization's membership is much more widely open. It is also the intent
of this group to appeal to all members of the Berkeley campus community with
unsatisfied computing needs and to provide a place for those interested in
computing to fully explore that interest. It is the intention of this group
that any OCF-sponsored computing facility always be controlled and maintained
by an open and inclusive group of students.
