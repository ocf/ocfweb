[[!meta title="Printing"]]

The OCF offers a certain amount of printing to individual members. You don't have to request a new account each semester - the quota is refreshed at the start of each semester.

Printing is currently limited to:

 * 100 pages per semester
 * 8 pages per day on weekdays
 * 16 pages per day on weekends

Please note:

 * Each **printed side** of a sheet counts as a page.
 * Jobs take time to process proportional to the job size.  If you submit a large job, please be patient while the print server processes it.


## Remaining quota

To see how many pages you have left for the day and semester, run the `paper`
command [[over the web|commands]] or [[in the shell|doc services/shell]]. Print
quota is also displayed at the top of the screen when using a lab computer.
Check your print balance regularly!

## Printing refunds

Pages are **not** normally refunded, except in cases of technical issues. In
this case, you should talk with the Publications Center staff at the front desk
for a refund.

## Technical details

See [[staff documentation|doc staff/procedures/printing]].
