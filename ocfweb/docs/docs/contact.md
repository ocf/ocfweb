There are several ways to contact the student volunteers who keep the OCF
running (hereafter referred to as OCF staff). If your question cannot be
answered by the **[[FAQ|doc faq]]**, we ask that you try coming to **[[staff
hours|staff-hours]]** before contacting us by email.

When contacting OCF staff, please reference

 * your OCF account name (if known)
 * the software you are using and any error messages encountered

## In person

The OCF lab is located on the ground level of MLK Student Union (entrance on
Lower Sproul), Room 171. You will need to show your student ID to the
front desk staff when you enter the lab.

OCF staff members are usually **not present** during lab open hours. To talk
with an OCF volunteer staffer, check the [[posted staff hours|staff-hours]].

## Email

Please do **not** send us your password over email, or your account will be
disabled.

**Do not email us about items lost in the lab.** The front desk is staffed by
paid employees, not by OCF volunteers. If you email us, the front desk staff
*will not see it*. If you've lost something, you should instead stop by
in-person to ask for it.
